PhenoTips.PatientClass_gender_hint=Sex should be recorded as biological sex rather than gender.
PhenoTips.RelativeClass_hint=Create links to other patients or family members in the system.
PhenoTips.PatientClass_global_age_of_onset_hint=The onset for the majority of the symptoms. Individual phenotypes may be designated with different onsets than recorded here in the Clinical Symptoms section.
PhenoTips.PatientClass_indication_for_referral_hint=This content can be a short summary or include content from the patient record. DO NOT RECORD any Protected Health Information.
PhenoTips.PatientClass_gestation_hint=Numeric value in weeks, such as “38” or blank if unknown.
PhenoTips.PatientClass_prenatal_development_hint=This content can be a short summary or include content from the patient record. DO NOT RECORD any Protected Health Information.
PhenoTips.PatientClass_medical_history_hint=Record notable issues in the medical history not already recorded above. This content can be a short summary or include content from the patient record. DO NOT RECORD any Protected Health Information.
PhenoTips.PatientClass_maternal_ethnicity_hint=Record maternal ethnicity, such as “White” or “Hispanic”. You may enter more than one ethnicity.
PhenoTips.PatientClass_paternal_ethnicity_hint=Record paternal ethnicity, such as “White” or “Hispanic”. You may enter more than one ethnicity.

PhenoTips.MeasurementsClass_hint=Create a list of patient measurements. These are dated, and a new set of measurements from a different date may be recorded by clicking the “New Entry” button again. The age of the patient at each measurement date will be displayed.
PhenoTips.PatientClass_omim_id_hint=Generally, a disorder is used to annotate the patient profile because it was either: tested and confirmed to be either present or absent OR suspected based on the manifestations (phenotypes), but not yet tested.
PhenoTips.PatientClass_select_phenotypes_hint=For each phenotype, choose the most specific term possible, based on the definition (available by clicking the “i”) and not necessarily simply based on the label. The more specific the item chosen, the better the specificity of the whole phenotypic profile. Record “Y” for Yes, to indicate a phenotype being present in the patient. You may provide annotations for things that were investigated and specifically not observed by clicking on the “N” for No. Choose terms that are thought to be pathological or unusual, even if they are not so in the greater populace. For example, ‘blue irides’ is a common phenotype in the population, but as a phenotype annotation, it is a subtype of ‘abnormal iris pigmentation’ and should only be chosen in cases where abnormal pigmentation is suspected, such as Heterochromia.
