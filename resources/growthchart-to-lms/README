This is a tool for converting growth charts into LMS triplets used by PhenoTips, using a Bash script and a GNU Octave program.

It takes as input a file with a series of lines in the following format:

<sex>,<age>,<low value>,<middle value>,<high value>

where:
- <sex> is 1 for boys, 2 for girls; if the data is valid for both sexes, use 1
- <age> is the age in months, starting with 0 for birth
- <low value> is the value for the lower percentile, 3% or 5%, depending on the chart; it can be a SD curve instead of a percentile curve
- <middle value> is the value for the 50% percentile
- <high value> is the value for the upper percentile, 97% or 95%, depending on the chart; this percentile should be symmetrical with the lower one: 3 and 97, or 5 and 95

For example:
1,0,3.4,4.04,4.73
1,12,4.03,4.615,5.445

Once an input file is prepared, it can be converted to the format expected by PhenoTips using generate-growth-curve-params.sh

First, edit the file and put the correct value for the "z" variable. If the chart had SD curves, then put the exact SD value: z=2 for 2SD curves, z=3 for 3SD curves, etc. There are precomputed values for z for the 95 and 97 percentiles, which are the most common.

Then run:

./generate-growth-curve-params.sh file.in > file.csv

The generated CSV file can be placed inside components/patient-measurements/api/src/main/resources/edu/toronto/cs/phenotips/measurements/internal/

Important: the lines must be sorted in ascending order of the age.
